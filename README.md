# Python Game Repo
This repo is a collection of simple games built in Python 3. This work represents an effort to have daily code to write to prevent my Python skills from waning. I make no claim the design of these games is optimal or that the code is as good as it could be. Hopefully someone, somewhere finds some value in this work as a educational tool. However, with the rise of AI, finding the Python code for a simple game is only one query away!
