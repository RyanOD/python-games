# Frogger Game
A clone of Frogger built with Python and the Pygame module library. Frogger is one of the all-time classic video games. Created in 1981 by Konami and published by Sega, Frogger challenges the player to guide five frogs safely across a highway crawling with vehicles and a river full of logs and turtles. Though simple by modern video game standards, Frogger is a great way for novice game developers to practice basic coding techniques and introduce themselves to the Pygame module without feeling overwhelmed.

## Approach
For this clone, we aimed to produce a version of Frogger that is very close to the original. However, not every aspect of the game was included. Specifically, those features that were redundant such as animating the turtles (we do animate the frog). We also skipped power updates, aligators, and snakes.

I've done my best to be true to the original game. However, this project began to be a bit of a time suck. To speed things up and get onto my next game clone, I left a number of small things out of the game. None these are complex to implement, but would have taken time I didn't feel I wanted to commit to furthering this project.
