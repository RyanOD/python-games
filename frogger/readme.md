# Frogger Game
A clone of Frogger built with Python and the Pygame module library. Frogger is one of the all-time classic video games. Created in 1981 by Konami and published by Sega, Frogger challenges the player to guide five frogs safely across a highway crawling with vehicles and a river full of logs and turtles. Though simple by modern video game standards, Frogger is a great way for novice game developers to practice basic coding techniques and introduce themselves to the Pygame module without feeling overwhelmed.
