# Word Guessing Game
This is a simple word guessing game built with Python. Players guess one letter at a time until all letters have been identified. While a very simple game, this is a classic first step in game development as it introduces the developer to many key programming concepts while not overwhelming them with too much complexity. The game uses the Random Word API on Heroku to generate all secret words.
